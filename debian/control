Description: Off-The-Record Messaging (OTR) protocol implementation for python
 This package implements the Off-The-Record Messaging protocol in pure python.
 .
 Off-The-Record Messaging (OTR) is a cryptographic protocol that provides
 encryption for instant messaging conversations. OTR uses a combination of
 AES symmetric-key algorithm with 128 bits key length, the Diffieâ€“Hellman
 key exchange with 1536 bits group size, and the SHA-1/SHA-256 hash functions.
 .
 The OTR protocol provides:
 .
 1. End-to-end encryption: No one else can read your messages.
 2. Authentication: The correspondent's identity can be verified.
 3. Deniability: The messages you send do not have digital signatures that can
    be checked by a third party. Anyone can forge messages after a conversation
    to make them look like they came from you, however during the conversation
    your correspondent is assured that the messages he sees coming from you are
    authentic and unmodified.
 4. Perfect forward secrecy: If you lose control of your private keys, you are
    assured that no previous conversation is compromised.
 .
 This package implements the version 2 and 3 of the OTR protocol.
